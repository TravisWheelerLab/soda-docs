Click and hover behaviors
=========================
This example showcases click and hover behaviors in SODA.
We'll start off with the code from the :ref:`drawing-rectangles<drawing rectangles>` example.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code-examples/click-and-hover/click-and-hover-1.ts
    :language: typescript

Hover behaviors are defined with a :ref:`HoverConfig`, which simply holds two callback functions: one that's called when the mouse moves over a glyph and one that's called when the mouse moves off of the glyph.
Once the HoverConfig has been created, simply pass it as an argument along with a list of Annotations to apply the behavior.
Here, we just supply a couple callbacks that print when the rectangles are hovered.
Open your developer console (f12 on most browsers) to check it out.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code-examples/click-and-hover/click-and-hover-2.ts
    :language: typescript

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../_static/example-builds/click-and-hover/index.html

SODA also provides a function that adds tooltips to glyphs.
A :ref:`TooltipConfig` at a minimum needs a callback function to define the tooltip text from the Annotation object that the glyph represents.
The TooltipConfig has optional styling parameters.

    :language: typescript

Click behaviors can similarly be defined with a :ref:`ClickConfig`.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code-examples/click-and-hover/click-and-hover-4.ts
    :language: typescript

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../_static/example-builds/click-and-hover-3/index.html
