This section explores the implementation of several toy example applications built with SODA.
Each example is presented in a tutorial format, but it is generally assumed that you have read the examples in order.
If you are searching for more detail on a particular part of an example, try skimming back through the previous examples.

Each tutorial embeds its corresponding SODA application within the webpage.
You can pan a visualization by clicking and dragging horizontally, and zoom by holding the ctrl key and using the mouse wheel.

Each example can also be found in the `examples section`__ of the GitHub repository.
