Click and Hover behaviors
=========================

The click and hover modules provides a simple way to add any number of arbitrary callback functions to be executed when a glyph is clicked or hovered by a user.

To add a click behavior, simply define a :ref:`ClickConfig` and pass it into the :ref:`clickBehavior` function.

To add a hover behavior, simply define a :ref:`HoverConfig` and pass it into the :ref:`hoverBehavior` function.

To see how this works, see the :ref:`click and hover example<guide-click-and-hover>`.
