Introduction
============

SODA is web-based library that aims to provide a generalized and modular framework for the generation of dynamic and interactive genomic visualizations.
Rather than a tool in and of itself, SODA is a library with which to build visualization tools.
SODA provides developers with a toolkit that lends itself to the creation of genome browsers, single-purpose tools, or something in between.
The visualizations produced by SODA can be easily integrated with web pages, and it is simple to define interactions between a SODA visualization and other page features.
