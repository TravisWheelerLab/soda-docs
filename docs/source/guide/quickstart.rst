Quickstart
==========

If you want to jump right into SODA code, you'd probably be best off viewing and running some of the simple examples_.
All you'll need to do is install npm_, clone the repository, and install the dependencies.

If you want to take it just a hair slower, head to the :ref:`simple examples tutorial<guide-simple-examples>`, which discusses the implementation of each of the simple examples in detail.

If you'd like to take a look at some more complicated code, you can check out one of the practical SODA applications:

- RepeatMasker-soda_
- Dfam-soda_
- PolyA-soda_
- ULTRA-soda_
